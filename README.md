# README

This is built with ruby on rails with a postgreql database.

It has multiple models that represent different sections on the resume.

The user model is the main model for this API and includes all other model info for an individual user upon successful authentication.

Thanks for reading! More clarity to come, hopefully? Continue to check back in for future updates!
